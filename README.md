# How To Use:

⚠️ WARNING! ⚠️
If you do not know what you are doing, this may mess with your computer. **MAKE SURE TO FOCUS THE MINECRAFT WINDOW BEFORE THE TIMER ENDS, AND PRESS `Numpad *` TO END THE SCRIPT.**

WARNING 2: If you are playing multiplayer, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
Using this bot on a multiplayer server may be considered cheating, and while I do not endorse cheating, if you do want to use this bot on multiplayer, please excersize caution and use this at your own risk.

Launch either "minebot" or "minebot-movement-only"

"minebot" will click, walk, turn, and spam sneak (funny)

"minebot-movement-only" will only walk and turn

Once you launch the program, you have 5 seconds to return to the Minecraft window, and then it will start executing commands.

You may have to tweak some of the code to get turning to work properly. To do this, Look in `DllCall("mouse_event", uint, 1, int, -200 AND 200, int, 0)` and change "200" and "-200" to values of your choice.

To close the script, press `*` (Numpad Asterisk Symbol)

This script is not meant to beat the game, or engage in PVP. I just made this bot to have a bit of fun and challenge myself.
